# Bash Commands I Like:

## Searching Hidden Files

```
$ ls -a
```

This shows hidden files in our directory.


## Showing History


```
$ git log -p
```
This shows all commits and the content of the file

## Discarding Changes

```
$ git restore 

or 

$ git checkout --
```


This command restore changes we made to our file and take us back to previous step.
